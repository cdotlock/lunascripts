# Writing MoonShort Scripts

You are generating scripts for a mobile interactive visual novel player. The genre is **TRPG mechanics + Galgame presentation**: players read through dialogue-driven scenes with character sprites and backgrounds (Galgame), and at key beats make choices that resolve via D20 attribute checks against a difficulty class (TRPG). Body-interaction beats (`@trick`) and optional embedded games (`@minigame`) punctuate the reading. Each `.md` script file is one episode — a self-contained narrative unit with dialogue, visual staging, game mechanics, and routing to the next episode.

The player experiences this as: tap to read dialogue → see one character at a time on screen (MC pinned left, others pinned right by the engine) → occasionally complete a forced body action (tap / hold / swipe / shake / swing / tilt) → occasionally skip-or-play a downstream-generated mini-game → at key beats make a choice that may roll dice → episode ends and routes to the next one.

Your scripts will be parsed by a Go interpreter that outputs JSON for the frontend. The interpreter is strict — syntax errors break the build. This guide teaches you to write scripts the interpreter accepts and the player renders well.

## File Basics

- Extension: `.md`
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Comments: `//` at line start
- Strings: double quotes `"..."`
- Blocks: `{ }` for nesting, indent for readability
- Every file has exactly one `@episode` root block

## Episode Structure

Every script follows this skeleton:

```
@episode <branch_key> "<title>" {

  // Narrative content (scenes, dialogue, choices, mini-games)
  // ...

  // Terminal — MUST be last. Exactly one @gate block.

  @gate {
    @if (<condition>): @next <target>
    @else @if (<condition>): @end <type>
    @else: @next <fallback>
  }
}
```

**Every episode ends with exactly one `@gate { ... }` block.** No `@gate` = `MISSING_TERMINAL` validator error.

`@gate` leaves are either `@next <branch_key>` (route to another episode) or `@end <type>` (terminate the story). A single gate may mix both — see "Routing (Gate)" below for the full pattern. The minimal forms are:

```
@gate { @next main:02 }            // pure unconditional route
@gate { @end bad_ending }          // pure terminal episode
```

The `branch_key` follows a strict addressing format. Read `references/addressing.md` for the full scheme.

## The Three Syntaxes in One File

MSS has three syntaxes that alternate freely:

**1. Directive lines** start with `@` — these control visuals, audio, game mechanics, and flow. Each `@` starts a new sequential step:
```
@bg set school_hallway fade
@mauricio neutral_smirk
@music tense_strings
```

**2. Concurrent directives** start with `&` — these execute simultaneously with the preceding `@` directive. Use `&` to group actions that should happen at the same time (e.g. scene setup):
```
@bg set school_hallway fade          // @ starts a new step group
&music tense_strings                 // & concurrent with bg
&mauricio neutral_smirk              // & concurrent with bg
```

**3. Dialogue lines** start with a CHARACTER NAME in caps followed by colon — these are what the player reads:
```
MAURICIO: Hey, Butterfly.
NARRATOR: Senior year. Day one.
YOU: He hasn't called me that in eight years.
```

Three special names: `NARRATOR` (third-person scene narration), `YOU` (MC's inner monologue), and any other name (character dialogue). Character names in dialogue are case-insensitive with their `@` directive counterparts — `MAURICIO:` in dialogue = `@mauricio` in directives.

**Syntax sugar — pose change + dialogue in one line:**
```
CHARACTER [pose]: text
```
This is shorthand for `@character pose` followed by `CHARACTER: text`. Use it to keep the script tight when a character's pose changes right before they speak:
```
MAURICIO [arms_crossed_angry]: Your call, Butterfly.
```

## Authoring Discipline — LLM Anti-Patterns

Read this before writing. LLMs reliably fall into specific traps that pass the parser but bloat the episode or break narrative flow. Self-correct against these as you write — the validator can't catch most of them.

1. **Don't mint a sprite library.** Aim for **~3–6 distinct poses per character per episode**, and **reuse aggressively**. Every new pose name has an upstream cost (semantic name → mapping JSON → OSS asset). If two beats both want "happy", reuse `gentle_smile` instead of minting `gentle_smile_morning_light_v2`. The character does not need fifty micro-expressions.
2. **Don't carpet-bomb music and SFX.** One BGM at scene start, with later `@music <new_name>` lines on major mood shifts, is usually enough — typically **≤3 distinct music tracks per episode**. Don't restart a track if the current one still fits. SFX should punctuate beats (a slap, a phone notification), **not** narrate ambient sound the player can imagine.
3. **Do change backgrounds when the location does.** The opposite failure: LLMs sometimes run two scenes off the same backdrop. If you wrote a scene-cut in your head (cafeteria → rooftop), that's two `@bg set ...` calls — backgrounds anchor the player's spatial sense.
4. **`@butterfly` feeds downstream content generators, not gate routing.** Butterfly's *only* consumers are downstream content-generation agents — **Remix Executor** (regenerating remix branches consistent with the player's pattern) and **Dream** (generating dream-sequence inserts). Gate evaluation does **not** read butterfly accumulation; all routing relies on deterministic state (`@signal mark`, `@signal int`, `@affection`, choice history). When you *do* want a beat to count toward future remix / dream generation, butterfly is the tool — write a specific description of what *this* player did that another player wouldn't have. Bad: "Made a choice." Good: "Showed vulnerability by accepting help from a former rival." For intra-episode story-flag branching use `@signal mark`; for repeat-event counters use `@signal int counter +1`.
5. **Don't write essay-length option text.** Choice option text is the player's UI button label — keep it under **~12 words**. Long narrative belongs *inside* the option block, not in the option text. Bad: `@option A brave "Stand your ground and tell him exactly how you feel about everything that happened last summer when he lied" { ... }`. Good: `@option A brave "Stand your ground." { ... }`.
6. **Don't compress when you should breathe.** LLMs default to terse summarization; Galgame pacing is the opposite. Let scenes land — an `@pause` after scene setup, an internal `YOU:` line between two pieces of dialogue, an extra silent beat after a confession. Token pressure pushes you toward "compress"; resist it. Players paid to live the moments, not skim a plot summary.
7. **Don't write side branches with no entry, or gate routes with no destination.** Every side episode (`main/route/...`, `main/bad/...`) you imagine needs a `@gate` somewhere upstream that routes into it via `@next`. Conversely, every `@next <branch_key>` in a `@gate` must point at an episode file you actually wrote. A beautiful unreachable bad-end is dead content; a `@next main/route/001:01` with no file is a broken link.
8. **Respect the concurrency rules.** `&` follows `@` and runs *together* with the previous step — it's for scene-setup bundles (bg + music + character entrance). `&` cannot lead a sequence, cannot be used on block structures (`choice`, `phone`, `if`, `gate`), and cannot be used on dialogue (`CHARACTER:` lines are always their own sequential step). `@trick`, `@minigame`, and `@cg` are leaf directives, so `&` is technically permitted on them, but you almost never want one of those bundled into a scene-setup group — keep them on `@` for narrative clarity. When in doubt, use `@`.
9. **Run the fixer before compiling.** The interpreter ships `mss fix <file>` that auto-repairs common LLM mistakes (missing `@if` parens, `&` on blocks, character-name casing in `@affection`, BOM/CRLF, unclosed blocks). **If the script was LLM-generated, run `mss fix` first, then `mss validate`, then `mss compile`.** This is the single highest-ROI habit when iterating with LLMs.

The directive table (`references/directive-table.md`) is the authoritative quick reference — when unsure of syntax, check it instead of inventing.

## Visual Directives

All visual directives use **object-action** order: `@<object> <action> [params]`.

**Scene setup** — use `&` to group the background, music, and character entrance that happen together at the start of a scene:

```
@bg set school_front fade
&music upbeat_school
&malia neutral_flat
```

### Characters

```
@mauricio neutral_smirk              // Enter / switch to pose (instant)
@mauricio arms_crossed_angry dissolve // Switch pose (crossfade)
@mauricio neutral_smirk fade         // Switch pose (fade in)
@mauricio bubble heart               // Emotion bubble (one-shot, auto-disappears)
```

Just two forms:

- **`@<char> <pose> [transition]`** — first appearance enters the character; subsequent uses switch their pose. Position is fixed by the engine (MC pinned left, others pinned right) — the script never specifies left/right/center. **Only one character is on screen at a time.** Whichever character speaks or is directed last replaces the previous one; `NARRATOR:` / `YOU:` clear the stage.
- **`@<char> bubble <type>`** — a one-shot bubble animation over the current character. Auto-disappears.

**`bubble` is a reserved word** — it cannot be a pose name. `@malia bubble` always parses as "play a bubble", never as "switch to a pose called bubble".

**Pose names** are semantic — they map to asset files via the interpreter. Use `snake_case`: `neutral_smirk`, `arms_crossed_angry`, `vulnerable_hopeful`. You can use any descriptive snake_case name, but **reuse aggressively** — target ~3–6 distinct poses per character per episode and reuse them across beats. Every new pose name carries a mapping-JSON + OSS asset cost.

**Bubble types (9, locked):** `anger` `sweat` `heart` `question` `exclaim` `idea` `music` `doom` `ellipsis`. The `<type>` argument is **required**.

**Transitions:** unset = instant; `dissolve` = 0.3s crossfade; `fade` = fade in. (Bg has its own transition set — see below.)

### Backgrounds

```
@bg set malias_bedroom_morning            // Default dissolve (0.5s)
@bg set school_front fade                 // Black screen transition (1s)
@bg set school_hallway cut                // Instant cut
@bg set dream_sequence slow               // Slow fade (2s, for mood)
```

### CG (Full-screen illustrations)

CG replaces the entire screen and is rendered by downstream agent-forge as a short video. **`@cg <name> "<content>"` is a leaf directive** — one line, no `{ }` body, no duration, no transition. The interpreter passes `<content>` to the video pipeline; agent-forge decides timing and camera based on the prose.

```
@cg window_stare "The camera opens on Malia's silhouette against the rain-streaked window. Slow push-in on her eyes — one tear tracks down, catching the cold blue of the skyline. Her reflection doubles her, ghost-like, in the glass."
```

- `<name>` is the asset handle. After agent-forge finishes generating, the URL is filled into `assets.cg.<name>`.
- `<content>` is a single English paragraph: concrete description of camera + story beat. No purple prose — what happens, what the camera does, what the frame emphasises.

CG carries **no embedded dialogue**. If a beat needs voiceover or inner monologue around the CG, write the dialogue lines **before** the `@cg` directive (the lead-up) and **after** it (the aftermath). The engine restores the previous background and any character afterwards automatically.

```
YOU: The city lights blurred through my tears.
@cg window_stare "The camera opens on Malia's silhouette against the rain-streaked window. Slow push-in on her eyes — one tear tracks down, catching the cold blue of the skyline."
NARRATOR: She stood there for what felt like hours.
```

`@cg` is symmetric with `@minigame`: both are leaf directives of the form `@<primitive> <name> "<prose>"` whose content prose is consumed by a downstream generation agent.

## Concurrency (@ vs &)

**`@`** = sequential. Each `@` directive starts a new step that executes after the previous one completes.

**`&`** = concurrent. A `&` directive joins the previous `@` directive's step group — they execute simultaneously.

**Dialogue** = always standalone. Each dialogue line is its own step that waits for the player to tap.

### Rules

- `&` CANNOT be used on block structures: `choice`, `phone`, `if`, `gate`, `episode`. These always use `@`.
- `&` is technically permitted on `@trick`, `@minigame`, and `@cg` (they are leaf directives), but bundling them into a scene-setup group is almost never what you want — keep them on `@` so the player notices the beat.
- A `&` line must follow an `@` line or another `&` line — it cannot appear at the start of a sequence with no preceding `@`.

### When to use `&`

- **Scene setup**: bg + music + the entering character should fire together:
  ```
  @bg set school_cafeteria fade
  &music casual_lunch
  &mark grin_confident
  ```
- **State changes that happen together**: multiple stat changes after a single event.

### When to use `@`

- **Standalone actions**: anything that needs to visually complete before the next step.
- **Anything that needs to complete before the next step**: a background change that sets the mood before the character appears.

### `@pause`

Wait for one player click before advancing to the next step. Use this to give the player a moment to absorb a new scene before dialogue starts. `@pause` takes **no arguments** — for longer beats, write multiple `@pause` lines in a row.

```
@bg set malias_bedroom_morning
&music calm_morning
&malia neutral_phone
@pause
NARRATOR: Senior year. Day one.
```

The player sees the scene load (background, music, and character all at once), then must tap once before the narrator line appears. This creates a natural beat — the player takes in the visuals before reading.

## Audio

```
@music calm_morning               // Start / switch BGM (engine decides from-silence vs crossfade)
@music stop                       // Stop BGM (fade out)
@sfx door_slam                    // One-shot sound effect
```

`@music <name>` is unified — the engine inspects the current playback state and either fades in from silence or crossfades from the current track. The script doesn't distinguish "play" vs "crossfade".

**Restraint matters.** A typical episode uses **≤3 distinct music tracks** (one per major mood block) and SFX only on punctuating beats. Don't restart a track if the previous one still fits, and don't underline narrated ambient sound the player can imagine.

## Phone / Messages

The phone overlay sits on top of everything. Keep messages short — they render in chat bubbles.

```
@phone {
  @text from EASTON: Can we talk? I miss you.
  @text from EASTON: I know I messed up.
  @text to MAURICIO: How do you know where I live?
}
```

- `@phone { ... }` pops the phone overlay; the block end automatically dismisses it. There is no `@phone hide`.
- `@text from <CHAR>: content` — incoming message (gray bubble, left).
- `@text to <CHAR>: content` — outgoing message (blue bubble, right).

**Whitelist: only `@text from/to` lines are allowed inside a `@phone` block.** No narration, no SFX, no state changes, no `@if` — those all live outside the phone block. Anything else inside `@phone` is a parse error.

## Game Mechanics

### Tricks (forced body-interaction beats)

`@trick <type> "<prompt>"` is a one-liner that forces the player to complete a small body action before the story advances. It's the embodied upgrade of `@pause`: the player must tap / hold / swipe / shake / swing / tilt the device, with a one-line on-screen prompt you author. There is no rating, no reward, no branching — the value is *presence*, not winning.

```
@trick hold "Hold your breath until he walks past."
@trick tap  "Tap fast to catch your breath before the next class."
@trick swipe "Wipe the steam off the mirror."
```

**The locked 6 trick types.** Pick one — the language does not allow inventing new types.

| `<type>` | Modality | What it can dramatise |
|---|---|---|
| `tap` | touch | running, struggling, knocking, applauding, heartbeat |
| `hold` | touch | holding breath, staying still, pressing on a wound |
| `swipe` | touch | wiping fog, brushing tears, pushing away — direction only |
| `shake` | motion | shaking awake, shaking a bottle, trembling, an earthquake |
| `swing` | motion | swinging a bat, casting a line, throwing a punch, knocking |
| `tilt` | motion | peeking around a corner, listening at a door, cocking your head to observe |

All six types use touch or device-motion sensors only — no camera, no microphone, no runtime permission prompt.

**Authoring rules:**

- `@trick` is a leaf — no `{ }` body. Adding one is a parse error.
- Pick a type that fits the *embodied verb* of the moment. "Holding your breath" is `hold`; "peek around the corner" or "listen at the door" is `tilt`. `swipe` is direction-only, not path-tracing.
- The prompt is the player-facing imperative. Keep it under one short sentence; write it in second person ("Hold your breath...", "Tap fast..."). It doubles as narrative glue.
- Use sparingly — typically 1–3 per episode at moments that *feel* embodied. Every trick is a forced gate; if the player can't perform the action they can't continue. Don't gate on a trick at a beat the player must reach.

### Mini-games (optional, downstream-generated)

`@minigame <name> "<description>"` is a one-liner that embeds an optional mini-game. The player can play or skip; the engine scales the reward by the H5 result if they play. The game itself is **generated by a downstream vibe-coding agent** from your `description`.

```
@minigame casino_showdown "Mauricio drags Malia into a backroom blackjack game — green felt, a low brass lamp, cigarette smoke, his friends watching — betting on who covers tonight's tab. The player taps to draw cards and taps Stand to hold, beating the dealer's hand without going over 21; three quick rounds. Win and Malia keeps her dignity; lose and she owes him a favor."
```

**Authoring rules:**

- `@minigame` is a leaf — no body, no attribute positional, no rating branching.
- The description is a single connected prose paragraph that does two jobs at once:
  1. **Set the scene.** Why is this game happening, what's at stake, who's there, what's the vibe?
  2. **Define the simple gameplay.** What does the player tap / drag / time, what's the core mechanic, what counts as winning? "Simple" is the key — give the agent direction, not a design doc.
- **Do not declare rewards or stakes in numbers.** Rewards are entirely engine-side (anti-cheat); the script never names coins, XP, SAN, etc. for the minigame.
- If you need a story branch off the minigame outcome (won / lost), promote it to a `@choice` — minigames don't drive narrative routing on their own.
- **Complexity ceiling for the vibe-coding agent**: think one-touch / one-drag mechanics, 30–90 seconds of play, a clear win condition you can describe in one sentence. Multi-screen puzzles, persistent inventory, networked play — all out of scope; rewrite as a `@choice` or a `@trick`.

### Choices (D20 Checks)

Every episode has one choice point. Each option has an ID (A, B, C...) and a mode (`brave` = triggers D20 check, `safe` = no check).

**Option text is the player's UI button label — keep it under ~12 words.** Long narrative belongs *inside* the option block as body nodes, not in the option text string.

```
@choice {
  @option A brave "Stand your ground." {
    check {
      attr: CHA
      dc: 12
    }
    @if (check.success) {
      @easton relieved
      EASTON: Can I sit?
      MALIA: You have two minutes.
      @affection easton +2
      @butterfly "Accepted Easton's approach at the cafeteria"
    } @else {
      @easton hurt
      MALIA: I... I can't do this.
      @butterfly "Tried to face Easton but lost courage"
    }
  }
  @option B safe "Have Mark make a scene." {
    @mark grin_mischief
    MARK: HEY EASTON! You want some of my mystery casserole?
    YOU: Thank god for Mark.
    @butterfly "Had Mark create a diversion to avoid Easton"
  }
}
```

**Rules for `brave` options:**
- Must contain a `check { attr: ... dc: ... }` block.
- Outcome branching uses a standard `@if (check.success) { } @else { }` tree. `check.success` / `check.fail` are context-local pseudo-identifiers valid only inside a brave option body.
- A missing `@else` is a narrative choice, not a syntax error — the validator does not require both branches to be populated. If you leave fail implicit, make sure the story still reads.
- Attribute names are freeform strings (the engine knows how to interpret them).

**Rules for `safe` options:**
- No check block, no outcome branching — safe options bypass the D20 entirely.
- Content goes directly inside the option block as plain body nodes.

**Every outcome path should include:**
- `@butterfly` description (what happened as a result of this choice — these records feed downstream content generators: Remix Executor and Dream)
- Optionally: `@affection` if the choice changes a relationship
- Optionally: `@signal mark` or `@signal int` if a *later* `@if` will branch on this beat

**Do NOT drop a `@signal mark` on every choice outcome.** Marks are only for key story points that a later `@if` branch or an `@achievement` unlock will actually query. See "State Changes" below.

## State Changes

These are declarations — the game engine handles the actual math.

```
@affection easton +2                                   // Character relationship
@butterfly "Accepted Easton's approach"                // Flavor memory for downstream content generators
@signal mark HIGH_HEEL_EP05                            // Key story point — queried later
@signal int rejections +1                              // Persistent integer counter — free to mutate
@signal int rejections = 0                             // Explicit reset / initialization
@achievement HIGH_HEEL_WARRIOR {                       // Achievement unlock
  name: "Heel as Weapon"
  rarity: rare
  description: "You turned an accessory into a warning."
}
```

> **Engine-managed values** (XP, SAN/HP, etc.) are set by the game engine, not scripts. You can reference them in `@if` conditions (e.g., `@if (san <= 20) { }`) but cannot modify them from scripts. The value names (san, xp, hp, etc.) are defined by the engine, not the script.

**`@signal <kind> <...>` — kind is mandatory.** Two kinds are implemented:

- `@signal mark <event>` — persistent boolean flag. Use sparingly; every mark must have a reader (see below).
- `@signal int <name> <op> <value>` — persistent integer counter. Free to mutate (`= N`, `+N`, `-N`). Read via `@if (name >= N)` comparison.

Achievements are **not** a signal kind — use `@achievement <id> { ... }` for those.

| kind | Role | Checkable in `@if`? |
|------|------|---------------------|
| `mark` | Persistent boolean flag. Engine stores it forever. `@if (NAME)` queries this store. **Use only for key story points** — hidden-route triggers and achievement-unlock guards. | **Yes** — becomes a `flag` condition |
| `int` | Persistent integer variable. Engine stores across episodes. `@if (NAME <cmp> N)` queries the value via comparison. Free to mutate as often as needed — counters are the whole point. | **Yes** — becomes a `comparison` condition with `left.kind="value"` |

For `mark`, `event` can be a bare identifier or a double-quoted string. For `int`, `name` is a bare `snake_case` identifier.

### Mark discipline — marks are NOT wayposts

**Every `@signal mark X` must have a reader.** Either some later `@if (X)` branch depends on it, or some `@if (X && ...) { @achievement ID { ... } }` unlock guard references it. If nothing reads it, delete it. Cluttering the flag store dilutes the signal (pun intended) and confuses downstream tooling.

**`@signal int` is not mark.** Counters are expected to be written often — `rejections +1` every time the player rejects Easton is exactly the point. The "marks are precious" discipline does NOT apply. Use `@signal int` whenever you need "if player did X at least N times" or "N-of-M threshold" branching. Prefer `@signal int counter +1` + `@if (counter >= N)` over stacking multiple boolean marks.

Guidelines for ints:
- Name in `snake_case` (e.g. `rejections`, `brave_count`, `times_met_easton`).
- Avoid names that look like engine values (`san`, `cha`, `hp`, `xp`) — the validator will reject these.
- `@signal int x = 0` is an unconditional assignment — if placed somewhere the player can revisit, it will reset the counter. That is the author's responsibility; the engine does not protect.
- For first-time reads, the engine treats undeclared variables as 0, so `@signal int x +1` and `@if (x >= 1)` work without any prior `= 0`.

**Write the mark second.** Start from the reader:

1. Identify the payoff — a hidden line of dialogue, a secret scene, an arc achievement
2. Write the `@if` guard that would unlock it
3. *Then* trace back to where the mark should be emitted

**Do NOT emit marks for things the engine already tracks:**

- ❌ `@signal mark EP01_COMPLETE` at the end of every episode — the engine knows which episodes the player cleared from episode_id itself
- ❌ `@signal mark CHOSE_OPTION_A` after a choice — the choice history is in the engine's choice log; gate `@if (A.success)` queries it directly
- ❌ `@signal mark AFFECTION_RAISED` — `@affection` already updated the number; `@if (affection.easton >= 5)` queries the value directly
- ❌ `@signal mark EASTON_ACKNOWLEDGED` as a character-moment marker with no follow-up — that's what `@butterfly` is for (feeds Remix / Dream, not boolean-queried)
- ❌ Don't use `@signal mark COUNTER_HIT_3` to track thresholds — that's what `@signal int` is for. Use `@signal int counter +1` then `@if (counter >= 3)`.

**DO emit marks for these cases:**

- ✅ **Hidden-route trigger**: A key moment in EP05 that a later episode's dialogue references:
  ```
  // EP05
  MALIA: One quick step. My heel went straight through his shoe.
  @signal mark HIGH_HEEL_EP05

  // EP10 — only players who did EP05 see this line
  @if (HIGH_HEEL_EP05) {
    NARRATOR: She glanced down at her shoes. She remembered.
  }
  ```
- ✅ **Arc achievement trigger**: Two or more marks feed into an achievement unlock guard:
  ```
  // EP05
  MALIA: One quick step. My heel went straight through his shoe.
  @signal mark HIGH_HEEL_EP05

  // EP24 — the second beat, and the place where the achievement fires
  MALIA: And again. Same shoe, same precision.
  @signal mark HIGH_HEEL_EP24
  @if (HIGH_HEEL_EP05 && HIGH_HEEL_EP24) {
    @achievement HIGH_HEEL_DOUBLE_KILL {
      name: "Heel Twice Over"
      rarity: epic
      description: "Once is improvisation. Twice is a signature move."
    }
  }
  ```
- ✅ **Single-beat achievement**: A singular narrative moment unlocks an achievement directly:
  ```
  YOU: I leaned in. He didn't pull back.
  @achievement FIRST_KISS {
    name: "First Kiss"
    rarity: uncommon
    description: "You stopped calculating and let it happen."
  }
  ```

**Name all signal events and achievement ids in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` English.** Keeps the flag store grep-able and unambiguous across the pipeline.

**Where to put the `@if ... { @achievement ID }` guard** for arc achievements: put it after the *last* mark in the chain is emitted — the guard only fires if every required mark is already set. Putting it at the start of an episode works too but is redundant (you'd re-check every time). One clean guard beats multiple scattered checks.

### `@butterfly` — feeds downstream generators, NOT routing

**Butterfly is content-generation memory, not a routing signal.** The engine accumulates butterfly records across the playthrough and hands them to two downstream LLM-powered agents:

- **Remix Executor** — when the player remixes a scene, butterflies inform the regenerated content so it stays consistent with the player's pattern.
- **Dream** — when a dream-sequence insert is generated, butterflies shape what the dream surfaces.

**Butterflies do NOT participate in gate routing.** `@gate` blocks evaluate only the deterministic state types — `@signal mark`, `@signal int`, `@affection`, choice history, and engine values. There is no `influence` condition. If no downstream agent will read this butterfly, don't emit it — it goes nowhere.

When you do want a beat to inform downstream content, write a clear, specific description of what *this* player did that another player wouldn't have. Bad: "Made a choice." Good: "Showed vulnerability by accepting help from a former rival."

For intra-episode story-flag branching use `@signal mark`; for repeat-event counting use `@signal int counter +1` then `@if (counter >= N)`.

### Achievements — `@achievement`

One directive, one form: `@achievement <id> { name / rarity / description }`. The block carries the full metadata and reaching this node in execution fires the achievement. Conditional triggering is just standard `@if` wrapping — there is no separate declaration step.

```
@if (HIGH_HEEL_EP05 && HIGH_HEEL_EP24) {
  @achievement HIGH_HEEL_DOUBLE_KILL {
    name: "Heel Twice Over"
    rarity: epic
    description: "Once is improvisation. Twice is a signature move."
  }
}
```

**Required fields (all three). Use English for all user-facing text:**

| Field | Type | Rule |
|-------|------|------|
| `name` | quoted string | English display name. Short, concrete, evocative (≤30 chars recommended) |
| `rarity` | identifier | One of: `uncommon` / `rare` / `epic` / `legendary`. **`common` is banned** — if every player gets it, it's not an achievement |
| `description` | quoted string | English DM-voice flavor text (1-2 sentences) |

**Trigger placement patterns:**

1. **Single-beat achievement** — fire inline at the moment the achievement makes narrative sense:
   ```
   YOU: I leaned in. He didn't pull back.
   @achievement FIRST_KISS {
     name: "First Kiss"
     rarity: uncommon
     description: "You stopped calculating and let it happen."
   }
   ```
2. **Arc achievement** — wrap in an `@if` that checks every required mark, placed right after the last mark in the chain is emitted:
   ```
   // Episode 24
   @signal mark HIGH_HEEL_EP24
   @if (HIGH_HEEL_EP05 && HIGH_HEEL_EP24) {
     @achievement HIGH_HEEL_DOUBLE_KILL {
       name: "Heel Twice Over"
       rarity: epic
       description: "Once is improvisation. Twice is a signature move."
     }
   }
   ```

**Same id in multiple places is fine** — the engine dedupes by id at unlock time. If you deliberately echo the same achievement from several narrative branches, write it out each time.

## Flow Control

### Conditional content

Use `@if` to show different content based on game state. **Parentheses `()` are mandatory** around the condition. The engine evaluates conditions at runtime. Use `@else @if` to chain multiple conditions.

```
@if (affection.easton >= 5 && CHA >= 14) {
  EASTON: You remembered.
} @else @if (affection.easton >= 3) {
  EASTON: ...I wasn't sure you'd come.
} @else {
  EASTON: ...Hey.
}

@if (san <= 20 || FAILED_TWICE) {
  YOU: I can barely keep it together.
}
```

**Condition types (5 kinds, all compiled to structured AST — the backend receives typed condition objects, not expression strings):**

| Type | Syntax | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| choice | `OPTION.result` | `@if (A.fail) { }` — result: `success` / `fail` / `any`. Use from outside the option |
| flag | `SIGNAL_NAME` | `@if (EP01_COMPLETE) { }` |
| comparison | `<operand> <op> <operand>` | `@if (affection.easton >= 5) { }`, `@if (rejections >= 3) { }`, `@if (affection.easton > affection.diego) { }` |
| compound | `<expr> && <expr>` / `<expr> \|\| <expr>` | `@if (san <= 20 \|\| FAILED_TWICE) { }` |
| check | `check.success` / `check.fail` | `@if (check.success) { }` — context-local, only valid inside a brave option body |

**`check` vs `choice`** — both touch D20 outcomes but answer different questions. `check.success` inside a brave option body asks "did *this* option's roll just succeed?" It's the idiom for writing `@if (check.success) { } @else { }` immediately after `check { }`. `A.success` from anywhere asks "at some earlier point, did the player pick option A and pass its check?" — retrospective, not context-local. Use `check.*` inside the option body it describes; use `A.*` / `B.*` everywhere else.

**Operators:** `>=` `<=` `>` `<` `==` `!=`
**Logic:** `&&` (and, binds tighter), `||` (or, binds looser). Use `( )` for explicit grouping.

### Comparison operands (5 kinds)

Both sides of a comparison are *operands*. The validator enforces that both sides have the same integer type, but **either side can be any operand kind** — variable-to-variable comparisons are fully supported, as are aggregate-to-literal, literal-to-aggregate, etc.

| Operand form | AST `kind` | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| `5` / `-2` | `literal` | Integer literal |
| `affection.<char>` | `affection` | Character affection score |
| `<name>` | `value` | Bare identifier — resolves either to an engine value (`san`, `cha`, `hp`, `xp`...) or to your `@signal int` variable. Same namespace |
| `MAX(<op>, <op>, ...)` | `max` | Aggregate of args. `args >= 2`, no upper bound. args may be any operand kind, including nested `MAX`/`MIN` |
| `MIN(<op>, <op>, ...)` | `min` | Same shape as `MAX`, returns the minimum |

`MAX` / `MIN` are **reserved words** and **must be uppercase**. Lowercase `max` / `min` are still legal as ordinary value names (no collision).

**Examples:**

```
@if (affection.easton >= 5)                                        // value-to-literal
@if (rejections >= 3)                                              // signal int read
@if (affection.easton > affection.diego)                           // value-to-value
@if (5 < affection.easton)                                         // literal-to-value (mirror form)
@if (MAX(affection.easton, affection.diego) >= 5)                  // 2-arg aggregate
@if (MIN(affection.easton, affection.diego, affection.mauricio) >= 3)   // 3-arg aggregate
@if (MAX(affection.easton, affection.diego, affection.mauricio, affection.elias) >= 8)
@if (affection.easton > MAX(affection.diego, affection.mauricio))  // aggregate-to-value
@if (MAX(affection.easton, MIN(affection.diego, affection.mauricio)) >= 4)   // nested
```

**Constraint:** `MAX` and `MIN` require at least 2 args. A single-arg aggregate is a parse error (it would degenerate to the arg itself — write the arg directly).

## Routing (Gate)

The `@gate` block at the end of every episode declares where the player goes next. Use `@if` → `@else @if` → `@else` chains. First match wins. `@else` is the fallback.

**Gate leaves come in two flavours, and a single gate may mix them freely:**

- **`@next <branch_key>`** — route to another episode
- **`@end <type>`** — terminate the story, `type ∈ complete | to_be_continued | bad_ending`

```
@gate {
  // Choice-based route to a bad ending
  @if (A.fail): @end bad_ending

  // Counter-based terminal
  @else @if (rejections >= 3): @end bad_ending

  // Mark-based hidden route
  @else @if (HEROIC_END_REACHED): @end complete

  // Affection-based good route
  @else @if (affection.easton >= 5): @next main/route/001:01

  // Fallback to main line
  @else: @next main:02
}
```

**Choice condition format:** `<option_id>.<result>` (dot notation, no space)
- option_id: A, B, C... (matches the option's ID)
- result: `success` | `fail` | `any` (`any` = regardless of check outcome)
- Example: `A.fail`, `B.success`, `C.any`

**4 condition kinds work inside gate** — `choice`, `flag`, `comparison`, `compound`. The fifth kind, `check`, is context-local to a brave option body and is **never** legal inside `@gate`. Routing relies entirely on deterministic state — there is no `influence` condition; butterfly accumulation feeds downstream content generators, not gate evaluation.

**Coverage:** every gate must be exhaustive. Either a single unconditional leaf (`@gate { @next main:02 }` or `@gate { @end bad_ending }`), or an `@if/@else @if/.../@else` chain with a mandatory `@else` fallback.

### Terminal Episodes

To terminate the story rather than route onward, write a gate whose leaves include `@end <type>`. The cleanest single-leaf form:

```
@episode main:15 "The End" {
  NARRATOR: The sun rose over a changed city.

  @gate { @end complete }
}
```

Three end types:

| Type | Meaning | Typical placement |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `complete` | Story fully ends — credits roll | Main ending episodes; true-end / happy-end |
| `to_be_continued` | Cliffhanger — next chapter not written yet | Last episode of the current release |
| `bad_ending` | Bad path terminus — player failed / died / broke the relationship | Episodes under `main/bad/...` |

You can also mix `@next` and `@end` leaves in one gate, e.g. a chapter finale that routes most paths into the next chapter but ends on `bad_ending` for the worst route:

```
@gate {
  @if (rejections >= 3): @end bad_ending
  @else @if (HEROIC_END_REACHED): @end complete
  @else: @next main:02
}
```

Only the three end types listed above are accepted; anything else is a parse error.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing `@gate`** — Every episode must end with exactly one `@gate { ... }` block. No gate = `MISSING_TERMINAL` validator error.
2. **Multiple `@gate` blocks** — Exactly one per episode, at the end.
3. **Missing `@else`** — Gate `@if/@else @if` chain without a fallback `@else` = interpreter error. Single unconditional `@gate { @next ... }` or `@gate { @end ... }` is fine (no chain, no fallback needed).
4. **Brave option without `check { }`** — Brave means D20 check. No check block = error.
5. **Brave option outcome branching with anything other than `@if (check.success) { } @else { }`** — that is the idiom. A missing `@else` is allowed (validator does not force both branches), but is usually still what you want.
6. **Putting `@gate` anywhere except the end** — Gate must be the last thing in `@episode`.
7. **Using character names inconsistently** — `@mauricio neutral_smirk` and `MAURICIO:` must use the same name (case-insensitive).
8. **Writing asset paths instead of semantic names** — Scripts use names like `classroom_morning`, not URLs or file paths. The interpreter handles mapping.
9. **Nested `@choice` blocks** — Only one `@choice` per episode. Multiple choices in one episode is not supported.
10. **Using `&` on block structures** — `&choice`, `&phone`, `&if`, `&gate` are all errors. Block structures always use `@`. (`@trick` / `@minigame` / `@cg` are leaves and technically permit `&`, but bundling them into a scene-setup group obscures the beat — keep on `@`.)
11. **Forgetting to use `&` for scene setup** — When a scene starts with bg + music + character entrance, the first directive uses `@` and the rest should use `&` so they execute together. Writing all of them with `@` makes them sequential, which looks choppy.
12. **Trying to set engine values from scripts** — `@xp`, `@san` are not valid directives. The engine manages these values internally. Scripts can only check them in `@if` conditions (e.g., `@if (san <= 20) { }`), not modify them.
13. **`@if` without parentheses** — `@if condition { }` is a syntax error. Must be `@if (condition) { }`. Parentheses are mandatory for both body `@if` and gate `@if`.
14. **Using `choice.A.fail` in gate conditions** — The `choice.` prefix is dropped. Use `A.fail`, not `choice.A.fail`. Dot notation: `A.fail`, not `A fail`.
15. **Invalid `@end` type** — Only `complete`, `to_be_continued`, `bad_ending` are accepted. Any other identifier is a parse error.
16. **`@signal` without a kind** — `@signal <kind> <event>` requires a kind token. Currently `mark` and `int` are implemented. `@signal achievement ...` is not valid — use `@achievement <id>` instead.
17. **`@minigame` with extra positional / body** — the form is `@minigame <name> "<description>"`, one line. No ATTR positional, no `{ }` body, no rating branches. Rewards are engine-owned. If you want a story branch off the minigame, promote it to a `@choice`.
18. **`@cg` with a `{ }` body, duration, or transition** — `@cg <name> "<content>"` is a leaf, one line, prose only. The pipeline decides duration and camera from the prose. If you need dialogue around the CG, write it on the lines before and after the `@cg` directive — not inside it.
19. **Orphan marks** — `@signal mark X` with no reader. If no `@if (X)` and no `@if (X && ...) { @achievement ... }` references `X`, delete the mark. Marks that no one reads are noise: they dilute the flag store and mislead downstream tools. Never emit marks for "episode completed", "chose option A", "affection raised", or anything else the engine already tracks.
20. **Using non-English names** — All `event` identifiers, `@achievement` ids, achievement `name`, and `description` strings must be English. Mixed-language ids cause grep/search failures and ambiguous meaning across the pipeline.
21. **Using `common` rarity on `@achievement`** — banned. Rarity must be one of `uncommon` / `rare` / `epic` / `legendary`. If every player gets it, it's not an achievement.
22. **Writing a `when:` field on `@achievement`** — `when` is not part of the grammar. Achievements carry only `name` / `rarity` / `description`; trigger logic lives in the outer `@if (...)` that wraps the `@achievement` directive.
23. **Duplicate `@achievement` ids in one episode** — validator error. If the same achievement spans multiple episodes, declare it once in whichever one most naturally owns it.
24. **Triggering an achievement that was never declared** — `@achievement <id>` inline without a matching `@achievement <id> { ... }` declaration is a runtime dead letter. The runtime registry must have seen the declaration first. (Cross-episode is fine; the engine loads all declarations.)
25. **Using `check.success` outside a brave option body** — a context-local pseudo-identifier. Outside its scope the runtime always returns false — that's a narrative bug, not a syntax error.
26. **Routing on butterfly / "influence"** — there is no `influence` condition. Butterflies feed Remix Executor and Dream, not gate routing. Routing uses `choice`, `flag`, `comparison`, and `compound` conditions.
27. **Single-arg `MAX(x)` or `MIN(x)`** — aggregate operators require `args >= 2`. A 1-arg aggregate is a parse error; write the arg directly instead.
28. **Lowercase `max(...)` / `min(...)` used as the aggregate operator** — `MAX` and `MIN` are reserved words and must be UPPERCASE. Lowercase `max` / `min` are legal as ordinary `@signal int` variable names; they will not parse as the aggregate.
29. **Bundle of `@phone` block with non-`@text` content** — only `@text from/to` lines may appear inside `@phone { ... }`. No narration, no SFX, no `@if`, no state changes. Move those outside the phone block.
30. **Inventing character positions** — there is no syntax for `at left` / `at right` / `at center`. The engine positions characters from `gamestate.MC` (MC pinned left, others pinned right). Anything you'd want to convey about staging — pose, bubble, transition — uses pose names and transitions, not position keywords.
31. **Orphan branches and dead `@next` targets** — every `@next <branch_key>` in a `@gate` must point at an episode file that exists in the repo, and every side episode (`main/route/...`, `main/bad/...`) you write needs an upstream `@gate` that routes into it. In single-file `mss compile` cross-file references aren't checked; in batch `mss compile <dir>` the validator does verify branch_key resolution.
32. **Essay-length option text** — `@option <ID> <mode> "<text>"` text is the player's UI button label. Keep under ~12 words. Long narrative goes inside the option block as body nodes.

**Auto-repair:** The interpreter includes a fixer (`mss fix <file>`) that auto-repairs many of these mistakes: missing `@if` parentheses, `&` on block structures, `@check` → `check`, uppercase character names in `@affection`, trailing whitespace, unclosed blocks, and BOM/CRLF encoding issues. Always run the fixer before compiling if the script was generated by an LLM.

## Remix Scripts

Remix scripts use the exact same format. The only differences:

- **Branch key** uses `remix/<session_id>:01` addressing
- **Content starts after the choice point** — the user's input replaced the original `@choice`
- **May or may not return to main line** — `@else: @next main:02` to rejoin, or `@else: @next remix/<session_id>:02` to continue the remix branch

```
@episode remix/abc123:01 "Mark's Casserole Incident" {
  @mark grin_mischief
  MARK: FOOD FIGHT!
  @sfx crowd_noise
  NARRATOR: The cafeteria descended into chaos.
  @butterfly "Mark started a food fight in the cafeteria"

  @gate {
    @next main:02
  }
}
```

## Pacing Guidelines

These aren't enforced by the interpreter, but they make for a good player experience:

- **Expand, don't compress.** LLMs default to terse summarization; resist that. A scene with one dialogue exchange is too thin — the player needs the inner monologue, the silent beat, the second look at the photograph. Token pressure pushes you toward compression; the player paid for the moments, not the plot summary.
- **Scene changes**: Use `@bg set ... fade` between locations. Don't change backgrounds mid-dialogue without a beat.
- **Character entrances**: Show one character at a time (the engine enforces this anyway). Let the player tap once after a `@<char> <pose>` directive before the character speaks.
- **Inner monologue**: Use `YOU:` liberally — it keeps the player in the protagonist's head and builds emotional investment.
- **Phone messages**: Keep them short (under 20 words per message). They're in chat bubbles.
- **Bubbles**: Use sparingly for emotional punctuation, not on every line.
- **Music transitions**: A new `@music <name>` between scenes feels like a fresh chapter; `@music stop` before silence or big moments lets the room breathe.
- **One choice per episode**: This is a design constraint. The whole episode builds toward one decision point.
- **Use `@pause` after scene setup** to let the player absorb the new scene before dialogue starts. A scene that jumps straight from setup to narration feels rushed.
